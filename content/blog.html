	<p></p>
	<p class="edit">Survived week 1 of my coding journey at Kickstart Coding. During the 		first week, we learned some basic coding terminologies such as the difference between 		front-end and back-end technology and what full stack means. We were also taught the 		basics of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap and like every aspiring programmer that came before us, 	made our very own "Hello World" page, officially marking the beginning of our coding 		journey. </p>
	<div></div>
	<p class="edit"> After surviving the hello world rite of passage, our first homework 		assignment was to create our very own personalized professional webpage (what you're 		reading right now!)  applying what we learned from the first week.</p>
	<div> </div>
	<p class="edit">For the second week, we will be learning about bash, git and Python. Stay 			tuned for more and feel free to follow  this page if you would like to see my 			progress and learn more about future projects  </p>
