        <h2 class="mb-5">Interests</h2>
        <p class="edit">Besides my current interest in learning programming, I love the outdoors especially hiking in Yosemite and riding my bike everywhere in the East Bay. </p>
<p></p>
 <p class="edit">The Bay Area has so much art, culture, diversity and food that I'm lucky enough to experience and indulge myself in everything it has to offer. I am a huge homebody and buy more books than I can I read and an avid videogamer.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="edit">Recently, I have been really interested in journalism and creative writing and guilty of spending too much time reading about politics on Twitter</p>
